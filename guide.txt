Step 1: update your system
Ensure your system is up to date

bash 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

step 2: install UFW
UFW is included in most Ubuntu installations by default, but you can install it if it's not present

bash
sudo apt install ufw

step 3: Enable UFW
By default, UFW is disabled after installation. Enable it with the following command:

bash 
sudo ufw enable

you will be promoted to confirm the action. Type 'y' and press 'Enter'

Step 4: Allow SSH Connections
To prevent locking yourself out of the system, allow SSH connections:

bash
sudo ufw allow ssh

Alternatively, you can specify the port number(default is 22):

bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

Step 5:Allow Specific Services and ports
You can configure UFW to allow services and ports based on your needs. Here are some common examples:

1. Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https

Or by Specifying the ports:

bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

2.Allow other specific ports:
For example, to allow traffic on port 8080:

bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp

3.Allow a range of ports:

bash
sudo ufw allow 1000:2000/tcp

4.Allow specific IP Addresses:
To allow connections from a specific IP address (eg:192.168.1.100)

bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.100

5.Allow specific subnets:

bash
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24

Step 6: Deny Specific Services and ports
By default, UFW blocks all incoming connections except for the ones explicitly allowed. You can also specify to deny certain connections explicitly:

1.Deny Specific port:

bash
sudo ufw deny 23/tcp

2.Deny Specific IP address:

bash
sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.0

Step 7:View UFW Status and Rules:
To check the Status of UFW and view the current rules:

bash
sudo ufw status verbose

Step 8: Delete UFW Rules
If you need to remove a rule, You can delete it using its rule number or the exact rule specification.

1. Using rule number
First, list the rules with numbers:

bash 
sudo ufw status numbered

Then delete a rule by specifying its number:

bash
sudo ufw delete 2

2.Using rule Specification:

bash
sudo ufw delete allow 8080/tcp

Step 9:Advanced UFW Configuration (Optional)

1.Logging:
Enable logging to monitor UFW activity:

bash
sudo ufw logging on

2.Default policies:
Set default policies to deny all incoming and allow all outgoing traffic:

bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

3.Application Profiles:
UFW includes profiles for some common applications. you can list these profiles:

bash
sudo ufw app list

Allow a specific application:

bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'

Step 10: Testing the Firewall 

1.check open ports:
Use 'nmap' for another machine to scan the open ports on your firewall-protected machine:

bash
nmap -v -A 192.168.1.10 # Replace with actual IP of your firewall-protected machine

2. Check connection:
Try to connect to allowed and denied services to ensure the firewall rules are working as expected.
